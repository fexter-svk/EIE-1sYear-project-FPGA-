# EIE 1st Year Project - Implementing Interactive Music Controls using an Altera Cyclone III on a Terasic DE0

## Description
Motion and body detection and tracking is becoming an increasingly important way to interact with computer systems, from information navigation to gameplay and even system authentication; it is fast developing into more than just a novelty. There is a real need to create dedicated, embedded hardware that is power efficient and streamlined for its operation. In this project, we demonstrate our proposed algorithm for real time body tracking using hardware acceleration implemented on an FPGA. The algorithm being used is a background subtraction with statistical prediction of points combined with markers.
